📝 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
======================

❓ Problem Statement:
In an increasingly digital world, the need for secure, accessible, and organized file storage is paramount. Users often struggle with fragmented storage solutions that lack intuitive interfaces or robust sharing capabilities. This project aims to solve this by providing a unified, cloud-based file management system that mimics the familiarity of Google Drive while offering secure storage, easy sharing, and cross-device accessibility.

💡 Solution Overview:
I have built a full-stack Cloud Storage Application that allows users to upload, organize, and share files securely. The application features a responsive, modern user interface built with Next.js 16 and React 19, coupled with a robust Node.js/Express backend. Files are stored securely in AWS S3, while metadata and user structures are managed in MongoDB.

🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
=======================

The project follows a Client-Server architecture:

1. 🖥️ Frontend: A Next.js application serves as the client. It handles the UI, routing, and user interactions. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
2. ⚙️ Backend: An Express.js server acts as the central API. It handles authentication, business logic, and interacts with the database and object storage.
3. 🛢️ Database: MongoDB stores user data, file metadata (names, paths, types), and activity logs.
4. ☁️ Storage: AWS S3 is used for storing the actual file binaries securely. Use of signed URLs ensures files are private by default and only accessible via the application.
